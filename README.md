FOR USE WITH [LagoLunatic's Randomizer](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/dsvrandom) ONLY

Utilizes `bwrite` (binary writing), but probably didn't need to. Don't trust?; don't use.

1. Type `/cvport` into your IRC console to create a new `portrait.dsvpreset` file.
2. Click the `Load Options from Preset File` button in the randomizer to apply it.

- For debugging the slider tuning, remove the `;` from the `echo`s below each segment.
- All options have different weights. Customize them as you please by changing the `if` requirements.

This only changes options that apply to Portrait of Ruin (aside from the sliders)
